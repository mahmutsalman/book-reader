# Code Signing Policy

## Acknowledgment
This project uses code signing services provided by the **SignPath Foundation**. We are grateful for their support in providing secure, trusted builds for the open-source community.

## Team Structure
To ensure the integrity of the signing process, we have defined the following roles:

* **Authors** (Commit Access):
    * Mahmut Salman ([@mahmutsalman](https://github.com/mahmutsalman))
* **Reviewers** (Code Review):
    * Mahmut Salman ([@mahmutsalman](https://github.com/mahmutsalman))
* **Approvers** (Release Authorization):
    * Mahmut Salman ([@mahmutsalman](https://github.com/mahmutsalman))

## Signing Practices
* Only official releases are submitted for signing via the SignPath platform.
* The signing process is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.
* All artifacts are verified before and after the signing process to ensure no tampering has occurred.

## Multi-Factor Authentication
To maintain security, all project maintainers with access to GitHub and SignPath are required to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
