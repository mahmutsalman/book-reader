# Privacy Policy

Smart Book Reader is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. We believe your reading habits should remain private.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Local Storage
* **Reading History:** All information regarding the books you read, your progress, and your library is stored locally on your device.
* **Vocabulary:** Words you save for lookup are stored in a local SQLite database.
* **Preferences:** Application settings are stored locally.
* **No Cloud Sync:** By default, this data is never uploaded to our servers.

### AI Integration (Groq API / LM Studio)
* The application offers an optional feature for word definitions and linguistic explanations using AI.
* **AI Providers Supported:**
  * **Groq API** - Cloud-based AI service (requires API key and internet connection)
  * **LM Studio** - Local AI running on your computer (no internet required, completely private)
* **Data Sent:** Only the specific word or phrase you select is sent to the AI provider.
* **Privacy:** No personal identifiers, account information, or full book contents are sent to any API. When using LM Studio, all processing happens locally on your device.

### Third-Party Services
* **SignPath:** We use SignPath for code signing. This involves sharing build artifacts, but no user data is ever shared with SignPath.

## What We Do NOT Collect
* We do not use analytics or tracking cookies.
* We do not collect crash reports automatically (unless you manually submit one).
* We do not sell or share any user data with third parties.

## User Control
You can delete your local database and reading history at any time by clearing the application data or uninstalling the app.
